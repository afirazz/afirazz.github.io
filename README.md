## Project Requirements


### Content
> Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 

The first thing you see when you open my portfolio website is a hero section with a round profile photo of me, a short introductory tagline about myself, and two social media icons that link to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles which bounce on hover (how I did this is detailed further in the [Bonus](#bonus-optional) section). This is followed by an About Me section which has a short biography of myself and a piture of my cat Joanna (which was supposed to be a placeholder image but is now a permanent fixture because I can't imagine this section without her lil sleepy face on it anymore).

Currently I have four placeholder 'coming soon' project cards in My Projects section that contain a list of languages/frameworks I will use for those projects. I'll be progressively filling in these project cards as I progress through the She Codes Plus program. Until then, please enjoy some photos of my cat Joanna as placeholders :) Lastly, my main page ends with a functional contact form powered by https://formspree.io/ and a footer with my copyright notice.

- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
​
### Technical
> Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
My portfolio website has a main landing page and another page that currently 

I have version controlled my portfolio website using Git and the version history of my files can be viewed on my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/afirazz/afirazz.github.io). My portfolio website has been deployed on GitHub pages and can be view through [this link](https://afirazz.github.io/). 

- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.

### Bonus (optional)
> Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 

Made the social media icons bounce on hover
Highlighted the navigational links in the header in brown on hover

- [x] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
​
### Screenshots
> Please include the following:
> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.  
> 
> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code: 

####  image_title_goes_here

### Future Improvements
I'm really happy with how my portfolio website has turned out but I also love continous improvement! Below I've listed some of the content and technical improvements I'd like to make in future iterations of my portfolio website.

- [ ] Have a brown bottom-border or box-shadow appear on the header as you scroll down the page. Currently it's difficult to differentiate the header when it's over the About Me section because they both have a cream background, however I don't want a bottom-border or box-shadow on the header when it's at the top of the page because you can see it clearly against the green background of the Hero section.
- [ ] Experiment with more curved and natural lines in my website design, e.g. using CSS masking to make my profile picture be masked by a blob shape, or making the top and bottom borders of my sections wavy.
- [ ] Add a personalised acknowledgement of country to the footer.
- [ ] Fix the header hyperlinks so that header doesn’t cut it off the headings.
- [ ] Fix the bug where the social media icons cut through the header when you scroll past it on desktop sizes.
